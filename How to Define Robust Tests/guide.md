# **How to Define Robust Tests**  

This document presents key principles and best practices for designing **robust and reliable tests** that enhance software quality and maintainability. It covers strategies to **reduce flakiness, improve test coverage based on risk and business impact, and optimize automation efficiency**. By following these guidelines, teams can build **stable, effective, and scalable** test suites, ensuring continuous software improvement and streamlined development workflows.  

## **1. Define Clear Objectives**  

### **What to Test**  
- Prioritize **core functionalities and critical scenarios**.  
- Implement **Risk-Based Testing** to focus on areas most prone to failure or those with the highest impact.  

### **What Matters Most to Users?**  
- **Real-user testing** – Gather usage metrics and feedback to identify high-impact features.  
- **Manual effort assessment** – Identify which features require extensive manual testing to optimize automation efforts.  

### **Why Test?**  
- Evaluate the potential **impact of failures** in different areas of the system.  
- Example: **A payment failure can directly affect revenue and user trust**, making it a high-priority testing area.  

### **How to Test?**  
- Select the **appropriate testing type** based on the context:  
  - **Automation** → Ideal for integration, regression, and repetitive scenarios.  
  - **Manual Testing** → Essential for UX validation, frequently changing features, and exploratory testing.  

## **2. Follow the FIRST Principle**  

To ensure efficient and effective testing, adhere to the **FIRST** principle:  
- **Fast** – Tests should run quickly to avoid delays in development.  
- **Independent** – Tests should not depend on one another.  
- **Repeatable** – Each test should produce consistent results under the same conditions.  
- **Self-validating** – Clear pass/fail criteria for easy validation.  
- **Timely** – Tests should be written at the right stage, ideally before or alongside the code.  

## **3. Automation Based on Testing Strategies**  

**Effective test automation** enhances reliability and efficiency. Key strategies include:  
- **Shift-Left Testing** – Detect and fix defects earlier in the development cycle.  
- **Continuous Delivery (CD)** – Automate testing within CI/CD pipelines (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD) to ensure constant feedback on code quality.  
- **Scalability** – Automate repetitive and high-volume testing for efficiency.  
- **Testing in Development Environments** – Ensure early-stage validations before deployment.  
- **Regression Testing** – Verify that new code changes do not break existing functionality.  
- **Integration Testing** – Validate interactions between different modules or systems.  

By applying these strategies, teams can create a **robust, scalable, and efficient** testing framework that supports high-quality software development.
