# Create a software quality process

### Creating a software quality process involves establishing systematic steps to ensure that software meets desired requirements and standards. I am sharing on this page some of the steps that I consider important in creating this process:

## 1. Define Objectives and Scope
Before implementing a quality process, itâ€™s essential to define:

* `Objectives:`  What do you want to achieve? (e.g., reduce production defects by 30%, increase test coverage to 80%).
* `Scope:` Identify the areas to be addressed (e.g., critical functionalities, performance, security).

## 2. Choose a Software Strategy
Select a software testing strategy that aligns with your project's goals, complexity, and timeline:

* [Shift-Left_Testing]: By starting the testing phase early in the development environment, we identify issues sooner, reduce downstream defects, and enhance overall quality.
* [Risk-Based_Testing]: Prioritize testing based on areas of the software that pose the highest risk.
* Behavior-Driven Development (BDD): Align development and testing with business requirements using tools like Cucumber.
* Exploratory Testing: Combine manual testing and creativity to uncover unexpected issues.
* Test Automation: Automate repetitive test cases to increase speed and coverage.

In my experience, implementing multiple strategies often leads to a more effective and efficient process. Combining approaches allows us to address challenges from different angles and ensures more comprehensive testing.
Here are some examples of strategies I have successfully implemented together:

* Shift-Left Testing
    - Identify potential ambiguities or issues in the requirements before development begins. One effective way to achieve this is by creating test cases early in the process. For instance, test cases can be written in the Gherkin format, which uses plain language to describe scenarios, making them accessible to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

* Collaboratively Refine the User Story Using BDD
    - Refining user stories through BDD enables us to clarify requirements collaboratively. This process involves creating a new ticket linked to the user story, detailing the test specifications required to validate it effectively.

* Exploratory Testing
    - Incorporating exploratory testing is always a valuable practice. It uncovers edge cases and unexpected scenarios that scripted testing might overlook, enhancing coverage.

* Test automation
    - Building and running automated integration tests before and during delivery to production ensures that system components work seamlessly together, reducing risks and enabling faster feedback loops.

By leveraging these strategies in combination, teams can achieve a more robust and streamlined testing process, ultimately delivering higher-quality software.

## 3. Create a Quality Cycle
A typical software quality cycle involves the following stages:

* Planning:
    - Define quality requirements. Select tools and methodologies (Agile, DevOps, etc.).

* Development:
    - Apply coding best practices (e.g., code reviews, design patterns).

* Testing:
    - Implement different test types (unit, integration, system, acceptance).

* Delivery:
    - Conduct final testing and validation with stakeholders.
    - Continuos integration/delivery.

* Monitoring and Continuous Improvement:
    - Collect metrics and post-production feedback.

## 4. Define Quality Metrics
Metrics are essential for measuring and continuously improving the process. Here are some key categories:

[Product_Metrics]

* Code Coverage: Percentage of code tested by automated tests.
    - Formula: (Covered Lines / Total Lines) * 100.
* Defects by Module: Number of defects found in each module. Helps identify problem areas.

[Process_Metrics]

* Defect Resolution Rate: Average time taken to fix a defect.
* Test Efficiency: Percentage of defects found during testing, before release.
    - Formula: (Defects Found During Testing / Total Defects Found) * 100.
* Delivery Velocity: Average time to implement a feature or fix a defect.

[Final_Quality_Metrics]

* Regression Rate: Number of defects reintroduced after changes.
* Production Defect Rate: Defects found by end users.
* Customer Satisfaction: Quantitative and qualitative indicators (e.g., NPS, satisfaction surveys).

## 5. Choose Tools and Infrastructure
Tools help automate and monitor the process. Examples:

* Requirements Management: JIRA, Trello.
* Quality Assurance: Selenium, Cypress, JMeter.
* Production Monitoring: Dynatrace, New Relic.
* Code Repositories: GitHub, GitLab.

## 6. Implement Automated Testing
Automation is critical for efficiency and consistency.

[Types_Automated_Testing]
* Unit tests (e.g., JUnit, pytest).
* Integration tests.
* Regression tests.

[Benefits]
* Reduces execution time.
* Ensures repeatability and consistent coverage.

## 7. Create Reports and Feedback
Regular reporting helps evaluate process effectiveness:

[Real-Time_Dashboards]
* Use tools like JIRA or Power BI to monitor metrics.

[Sprint_Reports]
* Open defects, resolved defects, and new test cases.

[Post-Release_Feedback]
* Gather insights from end users for future improvements.

## 8. Establish a Continuous Improvement Cycle
Adopt methodologies like Kaizen to continuously improve the process:

* Regularly analyze metrics and feedback.
* Identify bottlenecks or improvement areas.
* Implement incremental, monitored changes.
* Practical Implementation [Example] 
    - Objective: Reduce production defects by 20%.
    - Action: Introduce automated regression testing.
* Measure defects before and after each sprint.
* Metric: Monitor the Production Defect Rate and Test Efficiency.
* Tools: JIRA for defect tracking, Selenium for automated tests.

By following these steps and tracking metrics, you can establish a robust quality process and continuously enhance software, ensuring user satisfaction and operational efficiency.
