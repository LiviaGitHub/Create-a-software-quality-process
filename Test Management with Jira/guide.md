# 📌 **Test Management with Jira** 🛠️

Manage test cases and bugs effectively with Jira.

To use Jira for obtaining test metrics, you need to configure it effectively and integrate it with testing tools to gather data on test cases, defects, coverage, and quality. Here's a step-by-step guide to using Jira for test metrics:

---

## 🔧 **1. Configure Jira to Manage Test Cases**

While Jira is primarily designed for project and issue tracking, you can configure it to handle test cases:

### 📌 **Create Custom Issue Types**
✅ Add a new issue type, such as "Test Case," to manage your test cases.

### 📝 **Configure Custom Fields to Include Details Like:**
- ✅ Success criteria
- ✅ Pre-conditions
- ✅ Expected results

### 🔗 **Use Testing Plugins**
Integrate Jira with tools like **Zephyr**, **Xray**, or **TestFLO** to:
- 📌 Create and execute test cases.
- 📌 Link test cases directly to user stories or requirements.

---

## 🐞 **2. Track Defects Accurately**

Jira is highly effective for tracking defects. Optimize its use for detailed metrics:

### 🔗 **Link Defects to Requirements or Test Cases**
- Associate defects with backlog stories, epics, or test cases.
- Measure key metrics like:
  - 🟢 Defects by module
  - 🔴 Defects by functionality

### 🎯 **Use Custom Fields**
- 📌 **Severity**: Critical, Major, Minor
- 📌 **Priority**: High, Medium, Low
- 📌 **Defect Type**: Functional, UI, Performance

---

## 📊 **3. Generate Metrics with JQL Filters**

Use **JQL (Jira Query Language)** to create queries that generate specific metrics.

### 💡 **Example Queries:**

#### 📝 **Total Test Cases Created:**
```sql
issuetype = "Test Case"
```

#### 🔄 **Test Cases Executed in the Current Sprint:**
```sql
issuetype = "Test Case" AND sprint = "Sprint 1" AND status IN ("Done", "In Progress")
```

#### 🐞 **Defects by Severity:**
```sql
issuetype = "Bug" AND severity = "Critical"
```

#### 📅 **Defects Resolved in the Last Month:**
```sql
issuetype = "Bug" AND status = "Resolved" AND resolved >= startOfMonth()
```

---

## 📈 **4. Use Dashboards and Gadgets**

Create personalized **Jira dashboards** to visualize metrics in real-time.

### 🔹 **Steps to Create a Dashboard:**
1️⃣ Navigate to **Dashboards** → **Create Dashboard**
2️⃣ Add gadgets to display key metrics:

### 📊 **Recommended Gadgets:**
- 📌 **Issue Statistics**: Number of defects by severity or status.
- 📌 **Pie Chart**: Distribution of defect types or test cases.
- 📌 **Two-Dimensional Filter Statistics**: Combines status and priority.
- 📌 **Created vs. Resolved Chart**: Compares defects created and resolved over time.

---

## 📌 **5. Key Test Metrics in Jira**

### ✅ **Test Coverage**
- Track executed test cases with **Zephyr/Xray**.

### 🐛 **Defects by Module**
- Link defects to epics or components in the backlog.

### 📉 **Defect Resolution Rate**
```sql
status = "Resolved"
```

### 🔄 **Reopened Defects**
```sql
status = "Reopened"
```

### 🚀 **Test Execution Rate**
- Track execution metrics via **Zephyr/Xray**.

---

## 🔄 **6. Integrate Jira with Testing Tools**
